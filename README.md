## Description

This is a react app that tracks covid-19 data using the api https://covid19.mathdro.id/api.
CSS modules were used to style components. Material UI was used for Grid system, Cards, and
Typography. React-Charts2-js was used for the Pie and Bar charts. 

The Fixed left navigation bar was styled only with CSS and no Material UI.

The app is still very much a work in progress as more features will be added. The code will
also have to be refactored in some places to measure to clean code standards. 

All in all this is a very beginner level app that is used to practice front-end development 
with React skills.
